Assigning a scalar value to a dictionary results in the creation of a full length vector, either *Np* or *Nt* long, depending on the name of the array..

    "\n",
    "### Storage of Topological Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "Pore network modeling is actually just a form of graph theory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> During the development of OpenPNM, it was debated whether existing Python graph theory packages (such as [graph-tool](http://graph-tool.skewed.de/) or [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/) should be used to store the network topology.  It was decided that network property data should be simply stored as [Numpy ND-arrays](http://www.numpy.org/) as discussed above.  This format makes the data storage very transparent and familiar since all engineers are used to working with arrays (i.e. vectors), and also very efficiently since this allows code vectorization.  Fortuitously, around the same time as this discussion, Scipy introduced the [compressed sparse graph library](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.csgraph.html), which contains numerous graph theory algorithms that take Numpy arrays as arguments.  Therefore, OpenPNM's topology model is implemented using Numpy arrays, which is described in detail below:\n",
    "\n",
    "The only topology definitions required by OpenPNM are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A throat connects exactly two pores, no more and no less\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Throats are non-directional, meaning that flow in either direction is equal\n",
    "\n",
    "Other general, but non-essential rules are:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pores can have an arbitrary number of throats, including zero; however, pores with zero throats lead to singular matrices and other problems so should be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Two pores are generally connected by no more than one throat.  It is technically possible in OpenPNM to have multiple throats between a pair of pores, but it is not rigorosly supported so unintended results may arise."

    "### Sparse Adjacency Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenPNM network topology (or connectivity) is stored as an [adjacency matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix).  An adjacency matrix is a *Np*-by-*Np* 2D matrix.  A non-zero value at location (*i*, *j*) indicates that pores *i* and *j* are connected.  Describing the network in this general fashion allows OpenPNM to be agnostic to the type of network it describes.  Another important feature of the adjacency matrix is that it is highly sparse and can be stored with a variety of sparse storage schemes.  OpenPNM stores the adjacency matrix in the 'COO' or 'IJV' format, which essentially stores the coordinates (I,J) and values (V) of the nonzero elements in three separate lists.  This approach results in a property called ``'throat.conns'``; it is an *Nt*-by-2 array that gives the index of the two pores on either end of a given throat.  The representation of an arbitrary network is shown in the following figure. It has 5 pores and 7 throats, and the ``'throat.conns'`` array contains the (I,J,V) information to describes the adjacency matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "* In pore networks there is (usually) no difference between traversing from pore *i* to pore *j* or from pore *j* to pore *i*, so a 1 is also found at location (*j*, *i*) and the matrix is symmetrical.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since the adjacency matrix is symmetric, it is redundant to store the entire matrix when only the upper triangular part is necessary.  The ``'throat.conns'`` array only stores the upper triangular information, and *i* is always less than *j*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Although this storage scheme is widely known as *IJV*, the ``scipy.sparse`` module calls this the Coordinate or *COO* storage scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some tasks are best performed on other types of storages scheme, such as *CSR* or *LIL*.  OpenPNM converts between these internally as necessary, but users can generate a desired format using the ``create_adjacency_matrix`` method which accepts the storage type as an argument (i.e. ``'csr'``, ``'lil'``, etc).
